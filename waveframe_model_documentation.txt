Waveframe Hypothesis: Cleaned Model & Parameter Definitions
============================================================

Parameter Definitions
---------------------
All quantities are expressed in natural units (c = ℏ = 1, M_pl = 1).

- Λ (Lambda): Energy scale of the potential [unitless in natural units]
  Typical test value: 1e-3
- f: Decay constant that determines periodicity of the potential [unitless]
  Typical test value: 0.2
- φ₀ (phi_0): Initial value of the scalar field [unitless]
  Typical test value: 2.5
- 𝜙̇₀ (phidot_0): Initial field velocity [unitless]
  Typical value: 0.0 (field initially at rest)

Dynamical System
----------------
We evolve the scalar field φ(t) in a cosmological background using:

1. Klein-Gordon Equation:
   φ̈ + 3Hφ̇ + (Λ⁴ / f) * sin(φ / f) = 0

2. Friedmann Equation:
   H² = (1 / 3M_pl²) * [0.5 * φ̇² + V(φ)]

Potential Function
------------------
   V(φ) = Λ⁴ * [1 - cos(φ / f)]

   This is an axion-like potential with minima at integer multiples of 2πf.

Observable Quantities
---------------------
1. Hubble Parameter:
   H(z) is derived by transforming φ(t) and H(t) into redshift space.

2. Equation of State Parameter:
   w(z) = p_φ / ρ_φ

   where:
     ρ_φ = 0.5 * φ̇² + V(φ)
     p_φ = 0.5 * φ̇² - V(φ)

   w(z) ≈ -1 when the field is frozen; deviation from -1 implies dynamics.

Use Notes
---------
- Initial conditions should be chosen such that φ does not immediately roll to a minimum.
- Λ and f affect the dynamics critically: high Λ or low f leads to faster evolution.
- Integrate with stiff solver (e.g. Radau) to handle slow thawing.
