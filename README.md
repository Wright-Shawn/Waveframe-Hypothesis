# Waveframe Hypothesis

The **Waveframe Hypothesis** is a speculative cosmological model proposing that the universe exists within a vast, oscillating waveform—a cosmic rhythm that spans beyond the singular Big Bang. This framework reimagines cosmic evolution as a function of waveform geometry, where the *troughs* allow stable physics (like our current universe) to emerge, and *crests* reset the spacetime fabric, akin to Big Bang-like events.

## Basic Mathematical Structure

The universe's evolution is governed by a scalar field ϕ(t) under a cosine potential:

**Scalar field evolution:**

  ϕ̈ + 3Hϕ̇ + (Λ⁴ / f) · sin(ϕ / f) = 0

**Friedmann equation:**

  H² = (1 / 3Mₚˡ²) · [½ ϕ̇² + V(ϕ)]

**Potential function:**

  V(ϕ) = Λ⁴ · [1 − cos(ϕ / f)]

Where:
- Λ sets the energy scale
- *f* controls the waveform frequency
- Mₚˡ is the reduced Planck mass

## Why It Matters

- Proposes a **cyclic origin** for cosmological constants and time itself
- Reframes **dark energy** as a byproduct of waveform phase geometry
- Provides a **natural arrow of time** and entropy gradient
- Suggests **consciousness** may only emerge during waveform troughs — stable, phase-coherent epochs

## Summary

The Waveframe Hypothesis challenges the assumption of fixed cosmic laws. Instead, it imagines a deeper waveform structure where reality as we know it is one "low point" in a larger oscillatory sea. It blends scalar field dynamics with philosophical implications — aiming to anchor metaphysical speculation in empirical testability.
