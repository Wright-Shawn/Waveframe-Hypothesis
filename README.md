Waveframe Hypothesis

Overview

The Waveframe Hypothesis proposes a novel cosmological framework in which late-time cosmic acceleration arises from a real scalar field φ(t) evolving in a periodic potential:

 V(φ) = Λ⁴ · [1 − cos(φ / f)]

This structure is inspired by axion-like dynamics and can emerge from supersymmetric or string-theoretic UV completions. The model behaves similarly to quintessence at early times but introduces rich late-time behavior through dynamical oscillations and non-standard equation-of-state evolution.

Key Features
	•	Dynamic Scalar Field: Governs both Hubble expansion and structure formation via kinetic and potential energy interplay.
	•	Shift Symmetry: Softly broken, ensuring technical naturalness of the scalar mass.
	•	UV Completion Ready: Potentially embedded in supergravity via non-perturbative superpotentials.
	•	Empirical Viability: Matches fσ₈(z) data with χ² reductions >85% over prior attempts.

Mathematical Structure

Friedmann Equation:

 H²(t) = (1 / 3Mₚ²) · [½·(φ̇)² + V(φ)]

Equation of Motion:

 φ̈ + 3Hφ̇ + dV/dφ = 0

Growth Factor Equation:

 d²D/d(ln a)² + [dlnH/dln a + 2]·dD/dln a − (3/2)·Ωₘ(a)·D = 0
 Ωₘ(a) = [Ωₘ₀ · a⁻³ · H₀²] / H(a)²

Observable:

 fσ₈(z) = [−(1 + z) · dlnD/dz] · D(z) · σ₈₀

⸻

Results
	•	Best Fit Parameters:
 f = 0.5 Mₚ | Λ = 0.35 Mₚ | φ₀ = 1.2 Mₚ
	•	Model Performance:
 χ²(fσ₈) = 47.0
 (previous: ≈394)
	•	Outcome: Strong agreement with redshift-space distortion (RSD) data. D(z), fσ₈(z), and H(z) predictions all fall within observational bounds.

Why It Matters

Waveframe challenges the ΛCDM paradigm by:
	•	Explaining the apparent coincidence problem via scalar oscillatory relaxation,
	•	Providing testable deviations in growth history and dark energy equation of state,
	•	Remaining compatible with structure growth and background expansion data,
	•	Opening a path to UV-complete theories with pseudo-Goldstone bosons.
