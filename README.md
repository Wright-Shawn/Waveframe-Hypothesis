# Waveframe Hypothesis Documentation

---

## 📘 About the Model

The Waveframe Hypothesis proposes that our universe exists within the trough of a cosmic waveform, where scalar field dynamics modulate the shape and behavior of spacetime. This model aims to serve as an alternative to ΛCDM by positing that periodic scalar potential structures underlie cosmic acceleration, replacing dark energy with emergent phenomena from field oscillations.

## 🧠 How It Works

The Waveframe Hypothesis models the universe as driven by a scalar field ϕ(t) evolving under a periodic potential:

- **Scalar field potential**:  
  V(ϕ) = Λ⁴ [1 − cos(ϕ / f)]

- **Field evolution (Klein-Gordon equation)**:  
  ϕ̈ + 3Hϕ̇ + (Λ⁴ / f) sin(ϕ / f) = 0

- **Hubble parameter from Friedmann equation**:  
  H² = (1 / 3Mₚ²) [½ ϕ̇² + V(ϕ)]

---

## 🧪 Datasets Used

Two primary datasets were used to evaluate the model:

- **Pantheon+ Supernovae Sample**  
  • 1701 Type Ia supernovae  
  • Redshift: z ∈ [0.01, 2.3]  
  • Observable: Distance modulus μ(z)  
  • μ(z) = 5 log₁₀[d_L(z) / Mpc] + 25  

- **Cosmic Chronometers H(z)**  
  • 9 data points from Moresco et al.  
  • Redshift: z ∈ [0.1, 2.0]  
  • Observable: H(z) from galaxy age differentials  
  • H(z) = ȧ / a

## 💻 Numerical Methods

- **Scalar field potential**:  
  V(ϕ) = Λ⁴ [1 − cos(ϕ / f)]

- **Friedmann equation with field evolution**:  
  H² = (1 / 3Mₚ²) [½ ϕ̇² + V(ϕ)]

- **Time evolution (Klein-Gordon equation)**:  
  ϕ̈ + 3Hϕ̇ + (Λ⁴ / f) sin(ϕ / f) = 0

- **Physical redshift mapping**:  
  dz/dt = −(1 + z) H(z)

- **Likelihood evaluation (χ²)**:  
  χ² = Σ [(Data − Model) / σ]²
