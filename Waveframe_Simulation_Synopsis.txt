# Simulation Synopsis: Waveframe Scalar Field Model

The Waveframe Hypothesis models dark energy as an oscillating scalar field φ(t) with potential:  
**V(ϕ) = Λ⁴ [1 - cos(ϕ / f)]**

This model was evaluated against Hubble parameter data (Moresco et al.) and Pantheon+ supernovae. The system was solved numerically using the Friedmann and Klein-Gordon equations, including physical redshift-time mapping. Best-fit parameters were obtained via bounded minimization.

## Model Behavior Across Parameter Space

The field's contribution to the total energy density and the equation-of-state w_ϕ were evaluated across varying parameters. Late-time behavior was assessed for stability.

## Notes on Early-Universe Constraints

- **BBN Safety**: The model’s energy density remains subdominant at redshifts z > 1000, avoiding disruption of Big Bang Nucleosynthesis.
- **Turn-on Window**: Field dynamics activate primarily at z ≲ 1, aligning with late-time acceleration without affecting early-universe structure.
